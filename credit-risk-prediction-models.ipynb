It was included in the project for two main reasons:\n\nInterpretability: Its linear nature makes it easy to understand which features are most important and how they influence the final prediction. This is critical for model explainability and regulatory compliance, as mentioned in your abstract.\n\nBaseline Performance: As a \"traditional\" statistical model, it provides a solid baseline to compare the performance of more complex machine learning models like XGBoost and LightGBM. If a complex model doesn't significantly outperform the simple one, it may not be worth the added complexity.\n\n### How It Was Trained\nThe model was trained using GridSearchCV on the scaled data. Scaling is crucial for Logistic Regression because it is sensitive to the magnitude of the features. Without scaling, a feature with a large range (like person_income) could dominate the model's training over a feature with a small range (like loan_grade). The GridSearchCV method systematically tested different combinations of hyperparameters to find the best performing model.\n\n### Key Parameters Used\nC: This is the regularization parameter. It controls how much the model's complexity is penalized. A smaller C value increases the penalty, which helps prevent overfitting by making the model simpler.\n\npenalty: This specifies the type of regularization used. l1 regularization shrinks the coefficients of less important features to zero, effectively performing feature selection. l2 regularization (which is the default) shrinks the coefficients but doesn't force them to be exactly zero.\n\nsolver='liblinear': A specific algorithm used to optimize the model. It is an efficient choice for smaller datasets and for when you want to use l1 regularization.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### XGBoost with Tuning","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"\\nTraining and tuning XGBoost model...\")\n\n# Define the hyperparameters to search\nxgb_param_grid = {\n    'n_estimators': [50, 100, 200],\n    'max_depth': [3, 5, 7],\n    'learning_rate': [0.01, 0.1, 0.2]\n}\n# Initialize GridSearchCV\nxgb_grid_search = GridSearchCV(\n    XGBClassifier(random_state=42, use_label_encoder=False, eval_metric='logloss'),\n    xgb_param_grid,\n    cv=3,\n    scoring='roc_auc',\n    verbose=1,\n    n_jobs=-1\n)\nstart_time_xgb = time.time() # Start timer\nxgb_grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)\nend_time_xgb = time.time() # End timer\ntime_taken_xgb = end_time_xgb - start_time_xgb\n\n# Get the best model from the search\nbest_xgb_model = xgb_grid_search.best_estimator_\n\n# Evaluate the best model\ny_pred_xgb = best_xgb_model.predict(X_test)\ny_pred_proba_xgb = best_xgb_model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]\nroc_auc_xgb = roc_auc_score(y_test, y_pred_proba_xgb)\nf1_xgb = f1_score(y_test, y_pred_xgb)\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Best XGBoost Model Evaluation ---\")\nprint(f\"Time Taken: {time_taken_xgb:.2f} seconds\") # Print time\nprint(f\"Best Parameters: {xgb_grid_search.best_params_}\")\nprint(\"Classification Report:\")\nprint(classification_report(y_test, y_pred_xgb))\nprint(f\"ROC-AUC Score: {roc_auc_xgb:.4f}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 70)\n\n# Save the best model\njoblib.dump(best_xgb_model, 'xgboost_model.pkl')\nprint(\"Saved best XGBoost model to disk.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 70)\n\n# Save model metadata\nxgb_metadata = {\n    'model_name': 'XGBoost',\n    'best_parameters': xgb_grid_search.best_params_,\n    'roc_auc_score': roc_auc_xgb,\n    'f1_score_positive_class': f1_xgb\n}\njoblib.dump(xgb_metadata, 'xgboost_metadata.pkl')\nprint(\"Saved metadata for XGBoost model to disk.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 70)\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-08-27T11:59:28.185182Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-08-27T11:59:28.185846Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-08-27T11:59:39.318803Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-08-27T11:59:28.185813Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-08-27T11:59:39.317724Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"\nTraining and tuning XGBoost model...\nFitting 3 folds for each of 27 candidates, totalling 81 fits\n\n--- Best XGBoost Model Evaluation ---\nTime Taken: 11.05 seconds\nBest Parameters: {'learning_rate': 0.1, 'max_depth': 7, 'n_estimators': 200}\nClassification Report:\n              precision    recall  f1-score   support\n\n           0       0.93      0.99      0.96      4487\n           1       0.97      0.72      0.83      1241\n\n    accuracy                           0.93      5728\n   macro avg       0.95      0.86      0.89      5728\nweighted avg       0.94      0.93      0.93      5728\n\nROC-AUC Score: 0.9428\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSaved best XGBoost model to disk.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSaved metadata for XGBoost model to disk.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":7},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Calculate the confusion matrix\ncm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred_xgb)\n\n# Get class labels from the data, if available.

Why This Model Was Used\nXGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is one of the most powerful and widely used machine learning algorithms for tabular data. It was a perfect fit for this project because it is known for its high predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, which are essential for building a robust credit risk scoring system. It excels at capturing complex, non-linear relationships in the data.\n\n### How It Was Trained\nThe model was trained using GridSearchCV on the unscaled data. Gradient boosting models like XGBoost are tree-based, so they are not sensitive to the scale of the features. This makes them less reliant on a separate scaling step. GridSearchCV was used to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters that would result in the highest ROC-AUC score.\n\n### Key Parameters Used\nn_estimators: This is the number of boosting rounds or the number of decision trees to be built sequentially. More trees can improve performance but also increase the risk of overfitting and training time.\n\nmax_depth: This controls the maximum depth of each tree. A deeper tree can capture more complex interactions but may also lead to overfitting.\n\nlearning_rate: This determines the step size at each boosting iteration. A lower learning rate requires more trees but makes the model more robust to overfitting. The ideal learning_rate is usually a trade-off between model performance and training time.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Tuning","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"\\nTraining and tuning SVM model...

It is known for its effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces and for its ability to model complex decision boundaries.\n\n### How It Was Trained\nLike Logistic Regression, the SVM model was trained using GridSearchCV on the scaled data. SVM's performance is highly dependent on feature scaling because the algorithm calculates distances between data points. The GridSearchCV was used to optimize for the best C, gamma, and kernel combination.\n\n### Key Parameters Used\nC: The regularization parameter. It controls the trade-off between a smooth decision boundary and correctly classifying training points. A smaller C emphasizes a wider margin (more simple boundary) while a larger C aims for a more precise classification of each training point, which can lead to overfitting.\n\ngamma: The kernel coefficient for the rbf (Radial Basis Function) kernel. It defines how far the influence of a single training example reaches. A small gamma means a large influence, and a large gamma means a small influence.\n\nkernel: The kernel function specifies the type of transformation applied to the data. We used the 'rbf' kernel, which is highly effective for non-linear problems and is what allows the SVM to find complex, curved decision boundaries.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### LightGBM with Tuning","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"\\nTraining and tuning LightGBM model...\")\nlgb_param_grid

LightGBM Model\n## Why This Model Was Used\nLightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that is designed to be highly efficient and fast. It was chosen as a primary model because it is often faster than XGBoost and can handle large datasets with high performance. Its unique tree-growing strategy (leaf-wise vs. level-wise) makes it a strong competitor for real-time applications.\n\n## How It Was Trained\nSimilar to XGBoost, LightGBM is a tree-based model and was trained using GridSearchCV on the unscaled data. This makes it less sensitive to feature scaling. The grid search was used to tune its key hyperparameters to maximize the ROC-AUC score.\n\n## Key Parameters Used\nn_estimators: The number of boosting rounds or trees, similar to XGBoost.\n\nmax_depth: The maximum depth of each tree.\n\nlearning_rate: The step size shrinkage to prevent overfitting.\n\nnum_leaves: This is a unique parameter for LightGBM. It controls the maximum number of leaves in one tree. A larger number of leaves can increase the model's complexity and accuracy, but also its risk of overfitting.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 1D Convolutional Neural Network

Was Used\nA 1D CNN was included to explore a deep learning approach to the problem. While CNNs are most famous for image processing (where they use 2D or 3D convolutions), a 1D CNN is effective for tabular data and sequential data. It can automatically learn and extract important features from the input data, potentially discovering patterns that other models might miss.\n\n### How It Was Trained\nThis model was built using Sequential layers from Keras. Unlike the other models, it was not trained with GridSearchCV. Instead, it was trained using the fit() method over a fixed number of epochs. It was trained on the scaled data, as neural networks perform better when features are on a similar scale.\n\n### Key Parameters Used\nConv1D: This is the core layer. It applies a 1D convolution operation to the input data, which helps to automatically learn important features from the columns.\n\nDropout: This layer randomly sets a fraction of input units to 0 at each update during training. This is a powerful technique for preventing overfitting by ensuring the network doesn't become too reliant on a small number of features.\n\nDense: These are standard fully-connected layers. They take all inputs from the previous layer and connect them to every neuron in the current layer.\n\noptimizer='adam': The optimization algorithm used to train the network. Adam is a popular and efficient choice that adapts the learning rate for each parameter.\n\nepochs=10: The number of times the model will go through the entire training dataset.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Stacking Ensemble with XGBoost and LightGBM","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"\\nBuilding a Stacking Ensemble of
