/*
The following CSS variables define the main, public API for styling JupyterLab.
These variables should be used by all plugins wherever possible. In other
words, plugins should not define custom colors, sizes, etc unless absolutely
necessary. This enables users to change the visual theme of JupyterLab
by changing these variables.

Many variables appear in an ordered sequence (0,1,2,3). These sequences
are designed to work well together, so for example, `--jp-border-color1` should
be used with `--jp-layout-color1`. The numbers have the following meanings:

* 0: super-primary, reserved for special emphasis
* 1: primary, most important under normal situations
* 2: secondary, next most important under normal situations
* 3: tertiary, next most important under normal situations

Throughout JupyterLab, we are mostly following principles from Google's
Material Design when selecting colors. We are not, however, following
all of MD as it is not optimized for dense, information rich UIs.

<h2 id="Logistic-Regression-Model">Logistic Regression Model<a class="anchor-link" href="#Logistic-Regression-Model">¶</a></h2><h3 id="Why-This-Model-Was-Used">Why This Model Was Used<a class="anchor-link" href="#Why-This-Model-Was-Used">¶</a></h3><p>Logistic Regression is a foundational and highly interpretable machine learning algorithm. It was included in the project for two main reasons:</p>
<p>Interpretability: Its linear nature makes it easy to understand which features are most important and how they influence the final prediction. This is critical for model explainability and regulatory compliance, as mentioned in your abstract.</p>
<p>Baseline Performance: As a "traditional" statistical model, it provides a solid baseline to compare the performance of more complex machine learning models like XGBoost and LightGBM. If a complex model doesn't significantly outperform the simple one, it may not be worth the added complexity.</p>
<h3 id="How-It-Was-Trained">How It Was Trained<a class="anchor-link" href="#How-It-Was-Trained">¶</a></h3><p>The model was trained using GridSearchCV on the scaled data. Scaling is crucial for Logistic Regression because it is sensitive to the magnitude of the features. Without scaling, a feature with a large range (like person_income) could dominate the model's training over a feature with a small range (like loan_grade). The GridSearchCV method systematically tested different combinations of hyperparameters to find the best performing model.</p>
<h3 id="Key-Parameters-Used">Key Parameters Used<a class="anchor-link" href="#Key-Parameters-Used">¶</a></h3><p>C: This is the regularization parameter. It controls how much the model's complexity is penalized. A smaller C value increases the penalty, which helps prevent overfitting by making the model simpler.</p>
<p>penalty: This specifies the type of regularization used. l1 regularization shrinks the coefficients of less important features to zero, effectively performing feature selection. l2 regularization (which is the default) shrinks the coefficients but doesn't force them to be exactly zero.</p>
<p>solver='liblinear': A specific algorithm used to optimize the model. It is an efficient choice for smaller datasets and for when you want to use l1 regularization.</p>

<h2 id="XGBoost-Model">XGBoost Model<a class="anchor-link" href="#XGBoost-Model">¶</a></h2><h3 id="Why-This-Model-Was-Used">Why This Model Was Used<a class="anchor-link" href="#Why-This-Model-Was-Used">¶</a></h3><p>XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is one of the most powerful and widely used machine learning algorithms for tabular data. It was a perfect fit for this project because it is known for its high predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, which are essential for building a robust credit risk scoring system. It excels at capturing complex, non-linear relationships in the data.</p>
<h3 id="How-It-Was-Trained">How It Was Trained<a class="anchor-link" href="#How-It-Was-Trained">¶</a></h3><p>The model was trained using GridSearchCV on the unscaled data. Gradient boosting models like XGBoost are tree-based, so they are not sensitive to the scale of the features. This makes them less reliant on a separate scaling step. GridSearchCV was used to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters that would result in the highest ROC-AUC score.</p>
<h3 id="Key-Parameters-Used">Key Parameters Used<a class="anchor-link" href="#Key-Parameters-Used">¶</a></h3><p>n_estimators: This is the number of boosting rounds or the number of decision trees to be built sequentially. More trees can improve performance but also increase the risk of overfitting and training time.</p>
<p>max_depth: This controls the maximum depth of each tree. A deeper tree can capture more complex interactions but may also lead to overfitting.</p>
<p>learning_rate: This determines the step size at each boosting iteration. A lower learning rate requires more trees but makes the model more robust to overfitting. The ideal learning_rate is usually a trade-off between model performance and training time.</p>

<h2 id="Support-Vector-Machine-(SVM)-Model">Support Vector Machine (SVM) Model<a class="anchor-link" href="#Support-Vector-Machine-(SVM)-Model">¶</a></h2><h3 id="Why-This-Model-Was-Used">Why This Model Was Used<a class="anchor-link" href="#Why-This-Model-Was-Used">¶</a></h3><p>SVM is a powerful model for both linear and non-linear classification. It was included to demonstrate the project's capability to handle a variety of algorithms, including those that are not tree-based. It is known for its effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces and for its ability to model complex decision boundaries.</p>
<h3 id="How-It-Was-Trained">How It Was Trained<a class="anchor-link" href="#How-It-Was-Trained">¶</a></h3><p>Like Logistic Regression, the SVM model was trained using GridSearchCV on the scaled data. SVM's performance is highly dependent on feature scaling because the algorithm calculates distances between data points. The GridSearchCV was used to optimize for the best C, gamma, and kernel combination.</p>
<h3 id="Key-Parameters-Used">Key Parameters Used<a class="anchor-link" href="#Key-Parameters-Used">¶</a></h3><p>C: The regularization parameter. It controls the trade-off between a smooth decision boundary and correctly classifying training points. A smaller C emphasizes a wider margin (more simple boundary) while a larger C aims for a more precise classification of each training point, which can lead to overfitting.</p>
<p>gamma: The kernel coefficient for the rbf (Radial Basis Function) kernel. It defines how far the influence of a single training example reaches. A small gamma means a large influence, and a large gamma means a small influence.</p>
<p>kernel: The kernel function specifies the type of transformation applied to the data. We used the 'rbf' kernel, which is highly effective for non-linear problems and is what allows the SVM to find complex, curved decision boundaries.</p>

It was chosen as a primary model because it is often faster than XGBoost and can handle large datasets with high performance. Its unique tree-growing strategy (leaf-wise vs. level-wise) makes it a strong competitor for real-time applications.</p>
<h2 id="How-It-Was-Trained">How It Was Trained<a class="anchor-link" href="#How-It-Was-Trained">¶</a></h2><p>Similar to XGBoost, LightGBM is a tree-based model and was trained using GridSearchCV on the unscaled data. This makes it less sensitive to feature scaling. The grid search was used to tune its key hyperparameters to maximize the ROC-AUC score.</p>
<h2 id="Key-Parameters-Used">Key Parameters Used<a class="anchor-link" href="#Key-Parameters-Used">¶</a></h2><p>n_estimators: The number of boosting rounds or trees, similar to XGBoost.</p>
<p>max_depth: The maximum depth of each tree.</p>
<p>learning_rate: The step size shrinkage to prevent overfitting.</p>
<p>num_leaves: This is a unique parameter for LightGBM. It controls the maximum number of leaves in one tree. A larger number of leaves can increase the model's complexity and accuracy, but also its risk of overfitting.</p>

<h2 id="1D-CNN-Model">1D CNN Model<a class="anchor-link" href="#1D-CNN-Model">¶</a></h2><h3 id="Why-This-Model-Was-Used">Why This Model Was Used<a class="anchor-link" href="#Why-This-Model-Was-Used">¶</a></h3><p>A 1D CNN was included to explore a deep learning approach to the problem. While CNNs are most famous for image processing (where they use 2D or 3D convolutions), a 1D CNN is effective for tabular data and sequential data. It can automatically learn and extract important features from the input data, potentially discovering patterns that other models might miss.</p>
<h3 id="How-It-Was-Trained">How It Was Trained<a class="anchor-link" href="#How-It-Was-Trained">¶</a></h3><p>This model was built using Sequential layers from Keras. Unlike the other models, it was not trained with GridSearchCV. Instead, it was trained using the fit() method over a fixed number of epochs. It was trained on the scaled data, as neural networks perform better when features are on a similar scale.</p>
<h3 id="Key-Parameters-Used">Key Parameters Used<a class="anchor-link" href="#Key-Parameters-Used">¶</a></h3><p>Conv1D: This is the core layer. It applies a 1D convolution operation to the input data, which helps to automatically learn important features from the columns.</p>
<p>Dropout: This layer randomly sets a fraction of input units to 0 at each update during training. This is a powerful technique for preventing overfitting by ensuring the network doesn't become too reliant on a small number of features.</p>
<p>Dense: These are standard fully-connected layers. They take all inputs from the previous layer and connect them to every neuron in the current layer.</p>
<p>optimizer='adam': The optimization algorithm used to train the network. Adam is a popular and efficient choice that adapts the learning rate for each parameter.</p>
<p>epochs=10: The number of times the model will go through the entire training dataset.</p>
